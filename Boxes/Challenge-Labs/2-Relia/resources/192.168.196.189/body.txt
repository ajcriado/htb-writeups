Hey!
I checked WEBSRV1 and discovered that the previously used staging script still exists in the Git logs. I'll remove it for security reasons.

On an unrelated note, please install the new security features on your workstation. For this, download the attached file, double-click on it, and execute the configuration shortcut within. Thanks!

John
